## Project Title: Show Info

1. Create a folder with your name like `yourname` in this folder.

2. Inside `yourname` folder create a javascript file named `index.js`.

3. Open VSCode and edit `index.js` to Log "Your Name" into console.

4. Open terminal and go to `yourname`. Then run `node yourname.js`.
   Note: Check the message into console and exit by pressing Ctrl+C.

5. Install nodemon by running `npm install -g nodemon`

6. Run `nodemon yourname.js` to see your change into terminal as you up update the code.
   Note: For next steps, edit `yourname.js`and save it to see the result.

7. Log environment variables. If `NODE_ENV` is `development` log this app is testing.

8. Log how many bytes of memory the current process is using.

9. Import `os` module and log Platform and Architecture of your computer.

12. Add `getInfo` method that return an object like `Note {title} is created by {title} at {createTime}`.

13. Import newly created file `info.js` into `index.js` and create instance from `info` class with sample values.

14. Class getInfo and log it into console.

15. Define variable named `canExit` and set to `false`. Define a function named `readyToExit` that set `canExit` to `true` and log `I'm out.`

16. Run `readyToExit` after 3 seconds. Note: Use `setTimeout`.
