## Project Title: Products

1. Create a folder with your name like `yourname` in this folder.

2. Inside `yourname` folder create a javascript file named `index.js`.

3. Open VS Code and edit `index.js` to Log "Your Name" into console.

4. Install nodemon by running `npm install -g nodemon`

5. Run `nodemon index.js` to see your change into terminal as you up update the code.
   Note: For next steps, edit `index.js`and save it to see the result.

6) Create array `items` that show list of 5 item. Each item has `id`, `name`, `price` , `sellerId` and `inStock` property.

7) Create a route for list of products at `/prodcuts`.

8) Create a route for a specific product at `/prodcuts/:id`. If a product with requsted `id` does not found return `404` code and say `Product Not Found`.

9) Create a route for adding a product in `items` arrays at `/products` as POST request. If the id is duplicate it should send `400` error and say `Product is duplicate. Use another id`

10) Create a route for updating a product in `items` arrays at `/products` as PUT request. It should prevent updating `sellerId` and set `400` error and say `Seller can not be changed`.

11) Create a route for deleting a product in `items` arrays at `/products` as PUT request. It inStock is true it should not delete the item and return `You can not an item in stock`.

12) Use PostMan to test all above apis.
